## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about SVGs and how to use them. Also i improved in reutilizing different classes and distributing them well.

On another hand, i investigated about mobile first desing and i think this time i followed it by using `@media` with `min-screen` instead of `max-width`. This should improve performance on mobile devices.

### Continued development

I really want to perfect my responsive design. I think that, although my design fullfills the requirements, there are still flaws when changing the size of the device.

Also, you can never stop learning about flex and the things you can do. The most difficult thing for me in CSS is deciding on measures, like rem, percentages or pixels.
